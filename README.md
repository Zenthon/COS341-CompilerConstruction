#   Instructions:
    1. All the input files (.txt) must be placed in the same directory as the java class files and makefile.
    2. Next, open a the terminal in the directory and do the following:
       a. If you are on Windows and have JDK installed (preferably JDK 17), run the following command: **javac** ***.java** && **java** **Main**
       b. If you are on a linux machine / using WSL, run the following command: **make**
          i. This will run the makefile which will compile and run the class files for my parser and lexer.
       c. If you wish to not recompile the class files mentioned above, the class files have already been compiled and are in the directory. So all you need to do is to run the following command regardless of what OS you are using: **java Main**

    3. After the code has executed, you will be prompted to enter the test file name including the extension. E.g. **input.txt**
    4. Next you will be prompted to enter the name you want to name the xml file. E.g. **input.xml**
    5. If successful you should see the xml file if there were no lexical or parsing errors in the input file/ you should see a print in the console/ terminal if there are lexical or parser errors.
    6. If you see the following message in the terminal **Failed to read file to string.**, it means you typed in the wrong file name, or you did not put the files in the same directory as the class files.
