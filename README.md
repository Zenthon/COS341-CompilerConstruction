#   Instructions:
1. Please put all your input files (.txt) in the same directory as the java class files and makefile. 
2. Next, please do the following:
   1. If you are on Windows and have JDK installed (JDK version >= 11), run the following command: **javac** ***.java** && **java** **Main**
   2. If you are on a linux machine / using WSL, run the following command: **make**
      1. This will run the makefile which will compile and run the class files for my parser and lexer.
   3. If you wish to not recompile the class files above, the class files have already been compiled and are in the directory. So all you need to do is to run the following command regardless of what OS you are using: **java Main**

3. After the code has executed, you will be prompted to enter the test file name including the extension. E.g. **input.txt**
4. Next you will be prompted to enter the name you want to name the xml file. E.g. **input.xml**
5. If successful you should see the xml file if there were no lexical or parsing errors in the directory/ you should see a print in the console/ terminal if there are lexical or parser errors.

Should you struggle to compile my code/ run into issues, please contact me. My email is u20536951@tuks.co.za
